# Cangjie stdx

## This project is another wrapper for the Cangjie stdx library, designed to solve compilation and reference issues with the stdx library and make it easier for developers to use.

### Feature

No need for complicated configuration. Just add a line of configuration to `cjpm.toml` to use the `stdx` library.

```toml
[dependencies]
stdx = { git = "https://github.com/rarnu/stdxcj" }
```

## Introduction

Cangjie programming language provides `stdx` module, which provides common capabilities in the fields of network, security, etc. For detailed description of `stdx` API, please refer to the [document](./doc/libs_stdx/summary_cjnative.md).

## Constraints

Support for building `stdx` in Ubuntu/MacOS (x86_64, aarch64), Cangjie SDK 1.0.0 and above versions, please refer to the [Build Dependency Tools](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_build/blob/dev/docs/env_zh.md).

## Compilation and Building

### Build Steps

#### Configure Cangjie SDK

Configure the Cangjie SDK environment:

```shell
source <cangjie sdk path>
```

Execute the following command to verify whether the installation is successful:

```shell
cjc -v
```

#### Build Command

Download the source code

```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx.git
```

Enter the project directory, and run the following commands:

```shell
python3 build.py clean
python3 build.py build -t release --target-lib=<absolute path of openssl lib>
python3 build.py install
```

1. `build.py clean` command is used to clear temporary files in the workspace.
2. `build.py build` command starts the compilation：

    - `-t` or `--build-type`，specifies the type of build artifact, which can be either `release` or `debug`
    - `--target-lib` specifies the openssl lib directory

3. `build.py install` ommand installs the build artifacts to the `output` directory.

If the compilation is successful, a product directory named target by default will be obtained in the project directory.

### Get More Help Information

For more information, please take a look at the [build.py](build.py) or use `--help`

### Integration Build Guide

For integration building, please refer to the [Cangjie SDK Integration Build Guide](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_build/blob/dev/README_zh.md).

## Instructions for use

`stdx` provides two types of binaries: static and dynamic. Both are used independently and developers can reference them according to actual conditions.

### Import stdx

Add the following configuration to the `cjpm.toml` file of the code project:

```toml
[target.x86_64-w64-mingw32]                                                     # System architecture and OS information
  [target.x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["D:\\cangjiestdx\\windows_x86_64_cjnative\\stdx\\dynamic\\stdx"] # The stdx path is configured according to the actual situation
```

explain:

- x86_64-w64-mingw32：This configuration item indicates the operating system architecture information of the machine where the code is compiled. This information can be obtained by executing `cjc -v`. Developers should configure according to the actual situation. For example, the output of executing `cjc -v` is as follows, and the configuration is `x86_64-w64-mingw32`.
  
  ```text
  Cangjie Compiler: 0.59.4 (cjnative)
  Target: x86_64-w64-mingw32
  ```

- x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies：Please replace x86_64-w64-mingw32 in the configuration with the actual operating system information.
- path-option：`stdx` The path where the binary is located.

> **illustrate:**
>
> - `cjpm.toml` is the configuration file of the Cangjie package management tool CJPM. For details, please refer to the Cangjie Programming Language Tool User Guide.
> - The configuration method is the same for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
> - If you import the static library of `stdx` and use the crypto and net packages, you need to add `-lcrypt32` to the `compile-option` configuration item of `cjpm.toml` under the `Windows` operating system, and `-ldl` under the `Linux` operating system, because they need to rely on system symbols.

**Configuration example**：Assuming the development environment is Windows x86_64, import the dynamic binary of `stdx`, then the `cjpm.toml` configuration example is as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]

[package]
  cjc-version = "0.59.4"
  compile-option = ""
  description = "nothing here"
  link-option = ""
  name = "test"
  output-type = "executable"
  override-compile-option = ""
  src-dir = ""
  target-dir = ""
  version = "1.0.0"
  package-configuration = {}

[target.x86_64-w64-mingw32]                                                     # System architecture and OS information
  [target.x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["D:\\cangjiestdx\\windows_x86_64_cjnative\\stdx\\dynamic\\stdx"] # The stdx path is configured according to the actual situation
```

### Using stdx

In the Cangjie source code file that needs to use `stdx`, import the corresponding package provided by `stdx` through import, and then call the API provided by the package. The import format is:

**import stdx.fullPackageName.itemName**

`fullPackageName` is the package name given in [package list](./doc/libs_stdx_en/libs_overview.md#package-list), `itemName` is the name of a visible declaration or definition,  `*` means importing all visible top-level declarations or definitions, for example:

- import stdx.net.http.ServerBuilder：Import the top-level declaration of ServerBuilder in the net.http package of the stdx module.
- import stdx.net.http.\* ：Import the net.http package of the stdx module.
- import stdx.log.\* ：Import the log package from the stdx module.

### Usage Examples

Assuming that the developer is developing on Linux and wants to import the static binary of `stdx`, the `cjpm.toml` configuration reference is as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]

[package]
  cjc-version = "0.59.4"
  compile-option = "-ldl"
  description = "nothing here"
  link-option = ""
  name = "test"
  output-type = "executable"
  src-dir = ""
  target-dir = ""
  version = "1.0.0"
  package-configuration = {}

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
  [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["/target/linux_x86_64_cjnative/static/stdx"]  # stdx path is configured according to actual situation
```

Write code: Create an `HTTP` service using the `net.http` package.

```cangjie
package test

import stdx.net.http.ServerBuilder

main () {
    // 1. Build a Server instance
    let server = ServerBuilder()
                        .addr("127.0.0.1")
                        .port(8080)
                        .build()
    // 2. Register HttpRequestHandler
    server.distributor.register("/index", {httpContext =>
        httpContext.responseBuilder.body("Hello 仓颉!")
    })
    // 3. Start the service
    server.serve()
}
```
